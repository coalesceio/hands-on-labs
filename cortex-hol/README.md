To complete this lab, please create free trial accounts with Snowflake and Coalesce by following the steps below. You have the option of setting up Git-based version control for your lab, but this is not required to perform the following exercises. Please note that none of your work will be committed to a repository unless you set Git up before developing.

We recommend using Google Chrome as your browser for the best experience.

Note: Not following these steps will cause delays and reduce your time spent in the Coalesce environment!
